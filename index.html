        <p>
            I was this gloomy person with no friends. I felt that i never even existed in the world. Until one day my mom asked me Tishya do you want to code? i asked her to define code, she said that code means to learn computer language.<br><br>I was quite fond of computers but i didnt really think that i would get a chance to learn it .First i didnt even know what an app was or even pixels. And know i am this better person all because of coding .Coding has made me a more disipline ,punctual and a sucsessful person in life.
